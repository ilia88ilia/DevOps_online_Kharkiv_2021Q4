In the introductory course of my work with GitHub, the following steps have been taken:
1) A new private repository was created and cloned to the workstation, the ssh key from the workstation was linked with the GitHub account.
2) On the workstation, GitHub on Ubuntu VirtualBox was pre-installed, the text editor Atom was bound to GitHub as the main one.
3) Step-by-step actions were performed according to the terms of reference. 
As the result, local changes has been pushed to the "DevOps_online_2021Q4" GitHub repository, file "task1.1_GIT.txt" has been created.

As I see it, DevOps is an important chain of the control and correct operations,
the connection between the development process, implementation, and support of the working product.
