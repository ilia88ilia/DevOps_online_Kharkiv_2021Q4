4. VLANs have been configured in the Data Center. As a result, the computers in the data center stopped pinging 
because they belonged to different subnets :                  ![Network](Images/19.png "VLAN")
                                                              ![Network](Images/20.png "VLAN")

                                                              ![Network](Images/34 3_3.2dop.png "VLAN")  
															  ![Network](Images/34 3_3.3dop.png "VLAN")
8. The DHСP was configured:                                   ![Network](Images/24.png "DHCP")
                                                              ![Network](Images/25.png "DHCP")

                                                              ![Network](Images/28.png "DHCP")
															  ![Network](Images/29.png "DHCP") 
															  ![Network](Images/30.png "DHCP") 
9. The DNS service was configured. The work of the DNS service was checked:
                                                              ![Network](Images/31.png "DNS")
															  ![Network](Images/32.png "DNS")
															  ![Network](Images/33.png "DNS")
10. The Port forwarding on the Home Office was created and the it's work was checked:
                                                              ![Network](Images/34 3_4.1dop.png "Port forwarding")
                                                              ![Network](Images/34 3_4.2dop.png "Port forwarding")  
															  ![Network](Images/34 3_4.3dop.png "Port forwarding")
															  ![Network](Images/34 3_4.4dop.png "Port forwarding")
