4. Wireshark was installed. Traffic was captured using Wireshark.
                                                              ![Network](Images/Wireshark.png "Wireshark")														  
5. VLANs have been configured in the Data Center. As a result, the computers in the data center stopped pinging 
because they belonged to different subnets :                  ![Network](Images/19.png "VLAN")
                                                              ![Network](Images/20.png "VLAN")

                                                              ![Network](Images/332.png "VLAN")  
															  ![Network](Images/333.png "VLAN")
9. The DHÐ¡P was configured:                                   ![Network](Images/24.png "DHCP")
                                                              ![Network](Images/25.png "DHCP")

                                                              ![Network](Images/28.png "DHCP")
															  ![Network](Images/29.png "DHCP") 
															  ![Network](Images/30.png "DHCP") 
10. The DNS service was configured. The work of the DNS service was checked:
                                                              ![Network](Images/31.png "DNS")
															  ![Network](Images/32.png "DNS")
															  ![Network](Images/33.png "DNS")
11. The Port forwarding on the Home Office was created and the it's work was checked:
                                                              ![Network](Images/341.png "Port forwarding")
                                                              ![Network](Images/342.png "Port forwarding")
