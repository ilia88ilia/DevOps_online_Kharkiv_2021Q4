1. A password with "passwd" was changed:                ![Linux](Images/1.png "passwd")                                                 
2. Information was obtained about the users, about the commands being executed. 
   Personal information about yourself has been changed.:    
                                                        ![Linux](Images/2.png "passwd")  
                                                        ![Linux](Images/3.png "who")
                                                        ![Linux](Images/4.png "chfn")														
3. Familiarization with background information. ls -l displays the objects in the current directory.
   ls -la also displays hidden objects:                 ![Linux](Images/5.png "man") 
                                                        ![Linux](Images/6.png "man ls")
                                                        ![Linux](Images/7.png "info")
                                                        ![Linux](Images/8.png "ls -la")						
4. Working with "more" "less". Viewing .sh files :      ![Linux](Images/9.png "more") 
                                                        ![Linux](Images/10.png "less")
                                                        ![Linux](Images/11.png ".sh")														 
5. A plan has been drawn up:                            ![Linux](Images/12.png ".plan") 
                                                       

6. The contents of the home directory are displayed:     ![Linux](Images/13.png "ls -la")														
7. Lists the subdirectories using the "tree" command:   ![Linux](Images/14.png "tree")														 
8. The file type is defined with the "file" command:    ![Linux](Images/15.png "file")														
9. Navigation through the file system is worked out:    ![Linux](Images/16.png "pwd")
10. The commands ls -l, ls -la are practiced. 
    ls -la shows hidden files and directories in the current directory:   
	                                                     ![Linux](Images/17.png "ls -l -la")																 
11. Work with creating, copying, redirecting streams and deleting files and directories:   
                                                         ![Linux](Images/18.png "homecatalog")
12. Working with soft and hard links.
    After deleting the labwork2 file, the soft link is no longer working, the hard link is still working:   
                                                         ![Linux](Images/19.png "link")
                                                         ![Linux](Images/20.png "link")
                                                         ![Linux](Images/21.png "link")														 
13. Search for files containing the sequence "squid", "traceroute" using the "locate" utility:   
                                                         ![Linux](Images/22.png "locate")
14. Partitions mounted in the system (l-links, d-directories):
    													 ![Linux](Images/27.png "partitions")	 
15. Found files in the "/etc" directory containing the sequence "host", "ss" with "find", "grep":   
                                                         ![Linux](Images/23.png "find_grep")	
16. Printed the "/etc" directory into the "LIST.txt" file:   
                                                         ![Linux](Images/24.png "LIST")																 
17. Types of linux devices:
    - Character (byte-oriented): ports, tape drives, terminals, sound cards.
    - Block (block-oriented): hard drive.																	 
18. Defining file types:                                 ![Linux](Images/25.png "FIleTypes")		
19. First 5 files in the "etc" directory recently accessed:                                 
                                                         ![Linux](Images/26.png "tail")
